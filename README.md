# Statistical Rethinking in Julia

This is a repository containing answers in Julia to the questions in each chapter of the second edition of the book [Statistical Rethinking: A Bayesian Course with Examples in R and STAN](https://www.routledge.com/Statistical-Rethinking-A-Bayesian-Course-with-Examples-in-R-and-STAN/McElreath/p/book/9780429029608?utm_source=crcpress.com&utm_medium=referral). I used the [StatisticalRethinking.jl](https://statisticalrethinkingjulia.github.io/StatisticalRethinking.jl/v0.3/#Layout-of-the-package-1) package alongside the tutorials for answers in R from Jeffrey Girard (here's the one for [Chapter 2](https://jmgirard.com/statistical-rethinking-ch2/)) to help me when I got stuck. I've only posted the answers here so you'll need a copy of the book as well for anything to make sense. All the julia packages I used throughout are contained in [`requirements.jl`](https://github.com/haroontaylor94/Statistical_Rethinking_julia/blob/master/requirements.jl).

*N.B. I'd never coded in Julia before so the code is probably very bad.*
